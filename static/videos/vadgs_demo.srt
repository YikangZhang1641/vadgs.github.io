In this video, we are delighted to introduce VAD-GS, Visibility-Aware Densification for 3D Gaussian Splatting in Dynamic Urban Scenes.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Unlike object-centric settings, vehicle-mounted sensors are constrained by the driving trajectory.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:31,500
Existing GS methods achieve high-quality novel view synthesis with dense training views and well-initialized point clouds.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:41,900
However, their performance drops under large viewpoint changes, since photometric-based optimization fails to recover accurate geometry,

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
especially in dynamic urban scenes where both ego and surrounding vehicles are moving.

6
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,700
To address this challenge, our framework is designed as follows.

7
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:02,000
First, we analyze structural completeness for each static and dynamic instance in the reference image.

8
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:11,000
Through voxel-based visibility reasoning, our method generates a voxel distance map and a voxel index map for each view.

9
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:20,500
These maps are rasterized with z-buffering, enabling natural occlusion handling, and precise pixel-to-voxel mapping.

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Each voxel corresponds to multiple observed views.

11
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,500
We select the most diverse supporting views that covers the object with strong stereo cues.

12
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,500
These views are transformed into the object’s local coordinate frame,

13
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,000
enabling MVS reconstruction whether the object is static or in motion.

14
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:48,000
The recovered geometry is then used as a prior for further optimization.

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,900
Extensive experiments on the Waymo and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS approaches,

16
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,400
and significantly enhances the reconstructed geometry for both static and dynamic objects.

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:17,500
Compared with the baseline results, the normal maps produced by VAD-GS exhibit flatter and more continuous road and wall surfaces,

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
while the depth maps show higher geometric consistency with fewer fragmented structures.

19
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:35,500
For scene components that are poorly initialized, such as the traffic sign in the yellow circle, which is too high to be captured by LiDAR,

20
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:47,500
our method successfully reconstructs the geometry with minimal floating artifacts, and avoids erroneously projecting white text onto the foliage behind the sign.

21
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,500
Thank you for watching.
